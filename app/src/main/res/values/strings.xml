    <string name="newhelptext1">The goal of the game is to collect a hand where most or all of the cards can be\ncombined into sets and sequence and the point value of the remaining unmatched\ncards (Deadwood) is low.
</string>
    <string name="newhelptext2">You can end the play at your turn if, after drawing a card, you can form sufficient\nof your cards into valid combinations: sets and sequence. Any remaining cards from\nyour hand which are not part of a valid combination are called deadwood (Unmatched\ncards). The total value of your deadwood must be 10 points or less.
</string>
    <string name="newhelptext3">Knocking with no unmatched cards(Deadwood) at all is called GIN, and earns special bonus.
</string>
    <string name="newhelptext4">Each player counts the total value of their Deadwood (unmatched cards). If the\nknocker\'s count is lower, the knocker scores the difference between the two counts.
</string>

    <string name="newhelptext5">If the knocker did not go gin, and the counts are equal, or the knocker\'s count is\ngreater than that of the opponent, the knocker has been undercut. In this case\nthe knocker\'s opponent scores the difference between the counts plus a 25 point\nbonus.

</string>

    <string name="newhelptext6">A player who goes gin scores a bonus 25 points, plus the opponent\'s count in\nunmatched cards, if any. A player who goes gin can never be undercut. Even\nif the other player has no unmatched cards at all, the person going gin gets the 25\npoint bonus the other player scores nothing.
